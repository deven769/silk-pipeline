1. Asynchronous Data Fetching and Normalization:
	Leverage asynchronous programming to fetch and normalize data concurrently.

2. Batch Processing for Database Operations:
	Perform database operations in batches to reduce the number of individual operations.

3. Multiprocessing for CPU-bound Tasks:
	Use multiprocessing to parallelize CPU-bound tasks such as normalization, deduplication, and merging.

4. Efficient Data Structures:
	Use efficient data structures and algorithms to handle the large volume of data.
